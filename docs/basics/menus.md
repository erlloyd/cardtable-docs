  Then on a Desktop / Laptop clicking, holding, and dragging anywhere other than a card or token will pan the game table. On a touch device, when Pan mode is selected, dragging anywhere other than a card or token will do the same

  If Pan mode is deselected, then clicking and dragging (Desktop) or dragging anywhere other than a card will show a select box so you can select multiple card stacks.

## Draw cards mode

  If "Draw cards into hand" mode is selected

  Then when you automatically draw cards off the top of a card stack, they will immediately go into the player's hand. Otherwise they will drop on the table.

## Snap to grid

  If "Snap to grid" mode is selected

  When you click the "Notes" button
