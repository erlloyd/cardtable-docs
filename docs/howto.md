# Getting started

Cardtable is an online card game simulator that you can run in your browser. While it could support a variety of different games, it is currently focused on two cooperative Living Card Games (LCGs) by Fantasy Flight Games:

- The Lord of the Rings LCG
- Marvel Champions LCG

For the purposes of this help document, I'll be using Marvel Champions. I will show any differences between the games when applicable, however!

Cardtable has no concept of rules or logic specific to a game. While this is what gives it the flexibility to support many different games, it means you will have to remember and apply the rules for the game you are playing.

Let's discover **How to get started with Cardtable in less than 5 minutes**.

## Open Cardtable

To get to cardtable - simply navigate to https://card-table.app in any web browser! Note that most of the testing of this app has been done in Chrome, but it should work with any browser.

## Load a Scenario

Loading a Scenario is slightly different for the two games. For Marvel, you need to load multiple `Encounter Sets`. For LOTR LCG, you just need to load a single `Scenario`. To do either operation, right-click or open the menu, then select `Load Encounter Set` / `Load Scenario`.

Then, you can either scroll through all the options, or start typing part of the name of the set you are looking for, and the list will display the options
