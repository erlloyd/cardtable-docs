# Multiplayer Basics

:::warning
Multiplayer support is currently in beta. While it has been used successfully, there are many rough edges that need to be worked through. Proceed at your own risk!

One of the technical goals of Cardtable was to be able to play multiplayer games without needing a complicated server. For the most part, this is working in Cardtable, but hasn't been widely tested yet

## Creating a new game

Before anyone can connect to your game, you need to start a new multiplayer game. You can start a new game by opening the main menu (right-click or select the <img style={{height: "2rem", verticalAlign: "middle"}} src="/cardtable-docs/img/screenshots/menu-icon.png"/> menu button), and navigating to the `Multiplayer > Start hosting a new online game` entry.
